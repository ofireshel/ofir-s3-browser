# Under Construction Site

A minimal static page you can deploy to a new domain while the main product is being built.

How to use:
- Put your photo/art at `assets/under-construction.jpg` (recommended width >= 1600px).
- Open `index.html` in a browser to preview.
- Deploy the whole `under-construction/` folder to your host of choice (e.g., Cloudflare Pages).

Structure:
- `index.html` — page markup
- `styles.css` — styling (dark elegant theme)
- `assets/under-construction.jpg` — your image (create the `assets` folder and drop the file)
